## Read me
This software is an open-release under the study of **A pathologistâ€“AI collaboration framework for enhancing diagnostic accuracies and efficiencies** published in **Nature Biomedical Engineering**.

For the full information, please visit our homepage: https://huangzhii.github.io/nuclei-HAI/

If you are a pathologist/user/developer who plan to use this software for annotating / analyzing whole slide pathology images, please follow the tutorial below.

We are also releasing a Youtube tutorial soon. Please stay tuned!

## Download an example whole slide image.
```bash
cd nuclei.io/
mkdir example_data;
cd example_data;
mkdir CMU_Aperio;
wget -O CMU_Aperio/CMU-1.svs https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Aperio/CMU-1.svs
wget -O CMU_Aperio/CMU-2.svs https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Aperio/CMU-2.svs


## Initialization
We use Anaconda to manage the codes.
